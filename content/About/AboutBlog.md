### Why This Blog

When I was Younger, I had the dream of becoming a writer. But writing does not pay the bills, or mentally stimulate me like this field does.


I am trying to work on my articulation, and gaining back my pre- AI attention span, so that's another reason.


And lastly, and maybe what made me choose a blog as the medium of choice, is that every tech person has one. 

[Luciano Nooijen](https://lucianonooijen.com/) was the person that introduced me to Hugo. And the Idea of blogs.

And the more I looked, the more blogs I find:
- [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/)
- [Tania rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/)
- [Jef Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)
- Waiting for my Barber to open one


It is a nice way to share your 2 cents on something, write a guide, or have an easy to change about me section as I progress in the industry, and it is much more flexible than LinkedIn is.
