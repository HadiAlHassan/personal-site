Hi, I'm Hadi
{{< /typeit >}}

I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from the Lebanese American University, with a GPA of 3.81.

I have interned at many companies in Lebanon, involving myself with various areas of development, and the business side of things.


I am currently a Frontend Developer at [Wafeq](https://www.wafeq.com/en) (Run your Business Better, check us out!), we offer Accounting and e-invoicing solution for business owners and accountants.

## Some Background

In uni, I loved theory a lot, and teaching people how to think, so naturally I have the dream of becoming a professor later on.

But I was very afraid of implementation, and getting my hands dirty, so I am diving head first into the Development field, determined to try a slice of every pie in the industry (frontend, backend, devops, QA, ML, AI, you name it).


I have a goal of writing my own library, LaTeX IDE, compiler, and more!

## My Hobbies


In my spare time I like to eat, play video games, watch youtube videos, and ocasionally try to learn something new.
