These are some of the quotes that shaped my work ethic and mentality.

> It’s not **Hard**, It’s just **New**
>
> You are not stupid, just Inexperienced
---
I saw this somewhere on Reddit.

We regularly learn new things — we literally take new courses every semester and new concepts every day.

And you will always find yourself having trouble at first. The more time and effort you give it, the easier it becomes; more familiar, less alien.

Regardless of whether you enjoy it or not, the concepts stop being *hard* once they’re no longer *new*.

It might take a while for you to find comfort, that’s fine — just keep giving it effort.  
Sometimes I mastered concepts well after the course was finished (Algorithms).

So… whenever you start something and find trouble, remember:

> it’s not hard, it’s just new!

> Keep it Simple

Professor *Faisal Abu-Khzam*, a theoretical computer scientist specialized in Graph Theory and Parametrized Complexity, teaches at the Lebanese American University.  
He was my professor for Algorithms & Data Structures, Artificial Intelligence, and Theory of Computation — and the source of this quote.

At first I didn’t get it. It sounded like generic advice he repeated whenever he solved a problem or gave us tips during exams.

Then Algorithms ended (B- after the curve), and later, while revisiting it for AI and Theory of Computation, it finally clicked.  
The problems always yielded to the “dumbest”, most direct idea — the *simplest* one.

This pictorial explains it best:

The man scratches his ear with the farther hand when he could simply use the nearer one.  
We do the same as programmers: over-engineer solutions when a direct, clear path exists.

You’ll notice *KIS* everywhere, especially once you learn recursion (or “Lazy Coding,” as Dr. Faisal calls it).

> Shut up and Work
---
Said to me by my English 102 instructor during my first semester.

I was a nervous student — zero composure.  
During a synthesis assignment I did everything but synthesize: panic, questions, stress.

Then she hit me with the words:

> “You know, I think you’d get more work done if you did less talking and more working.”

It hit like a brick wall — and she was right.

We often overthink before starting anything: homework, projects, new goals.  
We tweak lights, music, “the mood,” waiting for perfect conditions.

Forget all that and just start.  
Starting itself puts you in the right mindset.

So whenever you want to start something and find yourself overthinking:

> Shut up and Work.

The same person who once worked as a busboy at Denny’s.


People think success is steady and easily reachable — that not succeeding means you never will.  
But this major (and life) is a journey: sometimes up, sometimes down, sometimes stagnant.

Successful people accept that failure is part of the process.  
Each fall teaches something essential for the next climb.

And once you succeed, failure doesn’t disappear; the two coexist — yin and yang.

So remember:

> If you want to be successful, build a tolerance for failure.

> You learn from your **failures** much more than your **successes**

From personal experience.

Grade 12 was not my year (by my standards):

- Average 17 / 20 — never hit 18  
- SAT 1330 (aim 1450 +)  
- Rejected from Carnegie Mellon Qatar  
- Missed 18 on official exams  

That year felt full of “failures.” But writing them down changed me.  
I entered university determined to exceed expectations — and I did:

- GPA 3.81 (High Distinction)  
- President of the Computer Science Club  
- Interned at three companies  
- Gained real insight into my field  

Looking back, had I scored 18 then, I wouldn’t have had that fire.  
Now I’m thankful I didn’t.

So remember:

> You learn from your failures much more than your successes.

> The Past does not define you
---
Originated as:

> “High School does not define you.”

Something I tell first-years entering university.

Like my own story, I didn’t let my terminal score define my university experience.  
Similarly, those who come in over-confident from high school should be cautious.

When generalized:  
Your past, failure *or* success, is not who you are.  
You must actively shape your story and decide its outcome.

So remember:

> The past does not define you.
