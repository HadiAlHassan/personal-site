A collection of books I have read, am reading, want to read, wishlisted, and whatever status I deem appropriate to add.

One of the classics in the Computer Science Literature, it gives you the what, not the how, for what a pragatic programmer does.

You know that wizzard of a programmer, that was way before AI and knows his stuff so well he made a book about it, and he casually goes on reddit and answers questions like a stack overflow user. That is Robert Nystrom, his book caught my interest, and since I want to go deeper into compiler design, find this book as an amazing start, once I am ready to begin it.
