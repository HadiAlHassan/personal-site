Hello There!

This is a test article as I navigate Hugo and all the tiny nits it offers.

---
The first question you may be asking, Why did I make a website?

Well, *I wanted to*, and at this point I need a portfolio.

Additionally, many great programmers and people in the industry have some sort of website (and many of them happen to use Hugo!) to keep track of their thoughts and opinions in their own Blog. As well as promote their libraries.

Plus it was a way for me to finally get over my laziness with posting something using cloudflare.

The hope from this blog is for me to keep track of my career as I progress through the years, and perhaps serve as motivation for me to learn more about stuff to place them in this blog here.

---

See you soon enough!
